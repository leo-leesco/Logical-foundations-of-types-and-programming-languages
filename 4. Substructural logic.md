# Substructural logic

Those rules are now removed :
- weakening (additional assertions are allowed)
- contraction (reusing assertions is allowed)
- (exchange (the order of assertions does not matter) : this one is not discussed)

We end up with new systems of logic :
- Structural (classical) : weakening + contraction
- affine : weakening
- linear : nothing
