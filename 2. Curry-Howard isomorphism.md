# Curry-Howard isomorphism

## Analogy

| Logic | Programming |
| -- |--|
| propositions | types |
| proofs | programs |
| natural deduction calculus | $\lambda$-calculus (extended) |

## Why ?

1. Logic can guide programming language design
2. Basis for type theory
3. Prove a logic formula only by looking at a program

## How does it look like ?

$$\Gamma\vdash M:A$$

means that, given the assumptions in the context $\Gamma$, $M$ is a proof term (or witness) corresponding to the proposition $A$ true. The context is defined as :
$$\Gamma:=\empty\mid\Gamma,x:A\ true$$

By design, $\Gamma\vdash A\ true\iff\Gamma\vdash M:A$.

The Curry-Howard isomorphism gives that $M$ is a program that has type $A$.
