# Introduction to constructive logic and its relationship to computation

By Prof. Brigitte Pientka

## Proposition

Given that $A$ and $B$ are two propositions, we have the following propositions (grammar):

$$A,B := \top\mid A\wedge B\mid A\vee B\mid A\supset B$$

## Judgmental view

(Analytic) judgments are those that become evident by conceptual analysis. We say that :

- A is $wf$ when it is well-founded proposition (syntactically true) :
$$\overline{\top\ wf}$$
$$\forall op\in\{\wedge,\vee,\supset\},\quad\begin{array}{rcl}
A\ wf&&B\ wf\\\hline
&A\ op\ B\ wf
\end{array}
$$

- A is true when it is a true proposition (in terms of meaning) :
    - introduction rule : introduces a connective
    - elimination rule : how to extract/synthesize information out of a give connective

$$\overline{\top\ true}^{\top_I}$$

$$\begin{array}{rcl}
A\ true&&B\ true\\\hline
&A\ \wedge\ B\ true
\end{array}\wedge_I
$$

$$\begin{array}{c}
A\wedge B\ true\\\hline
A\ true
\end{array}\wedge_{E_\ell}
$$

$$\begin{array}{c}
A\wedge B\ true\\\hline
B\ true
\end{array}\wedge_{E_r}
$$

Some properties of propositions :
- weakening : we don't have to use every assumption
- contraction : we can reuse as many times as we want something we know to be true
- substitution : if $\Gamma,x:A\ true\vdash C\ true$ and $\Gamma\vdash A\ true$, then $\Gamma\vdash C\ true$

For this reason, we introduce context, that carries on to the next deduction : 
$$\Gamma:=\empty\mid\Gamma,x:A\ true$$

We have local soundness (the combination of introduction and elmination rules is not too strong i.e. they don't allow to infer more than what is already known) and local completeness (the combination of introduction and elmination rules is sufficiently strong).
