# Introduction to constructive logic and its relationship to computation

## Proposition

Given that $A$ and $B$ are two propositions, we have the following propositions (grammar):

$$A,B := \top\mid A\wedge B\mid A\vee B\mid A\supset B$$

## Judgmental view

(Analytic) judgments are those that become evident by conceptual analysis. We say that :

- A is $wf$ when it is well-founded proposition (syntactically true) :
$$\overline{\top\ wf}$$
$$\forall op\in\{\wedge,\vee,\supset\},\quad\begin{array}{rcl}
A\ wf&&B\ wf\\\hline
&A\ op\ B\ wf
\end{array}
$$
- A is true when it is a true proposition (in terms of meaning) :
    - introduction rule : introduces a connective
    - elimination rule : how to extract/synthesize information out of a give connective
